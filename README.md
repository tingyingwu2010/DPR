Run "train.py" to train the model. A pre-trained model is provided under "model/ppo_1/ppo.pth". "test.ipynb" provides the test code for solving benchmark problems (Solomon benchmark and Gehring & Homberger benchmark). Please unzip "data.zip" before testing the model. Our synthetic dataset are provided in "validation_set.zip".

Example:
```
python train.py --epoch 10000
